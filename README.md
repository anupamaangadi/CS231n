# CS231n--Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Winter, 2015)

This repository contains my attempted solutions for the Stanford deep learning class: [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).

I'm much obliged to the team of CS231n, for offering such a great class which elucidates clearly in the intuition and all the math behind neural networks.
